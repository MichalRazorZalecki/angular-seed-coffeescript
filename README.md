# The seed for AngularJS with CoffeeScript apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical 
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app with 
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). It is based on the 
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) so if you are looking 
informations about angular-seed itself read orginal 
[README.md](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/blob/master/README.md)
